TODO:

* (config) Simplify configuration.
	Currently the amount of code you must insert into LocalSettings.php
	is ridiculous (see [tests/travis/AWSSettings.php] for an example).
	Most users would only set (1) $wgAWSRegion and (2) bucket prefix.
	Private wikis would additionally set url of public/thumb to false,
	and add "privateWiki" key to $wgLocalFileRepo
	(both steps are optional, read-restricted wiki is auto-detected).

* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.
