TODO:
* (feature) Improve the syntax of $wgAWSBucketDomain (too restrictive).
	E.g. we might want to have S3 bucket "mysite-media-thumb" available under
	the URL "media.example.com" (where $wgAWSBucketPrefix="mysite-media").
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.

Tests needed:
* Configuration test (calculation of $wgLocalFileRepo from $wgAWSBucketPrefix, etc.).
