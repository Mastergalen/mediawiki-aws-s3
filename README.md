This is a fork of Extension:AWS [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AWS].

The fork was made because:
1) We need this extension in production (it is the most correct way to use
Amazon S3 as image repository)
2) Extension was marked by its author as experimental (not even beta), and
we found (and fixed) some bugs in it,
3) We must apply bugfixes and improvements ASAP and can't wait for upstream
(original extension is unmaintained and they haven't been reviewed for a year).
